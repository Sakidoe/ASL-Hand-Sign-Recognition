# ASL Hand Sign Recognition AI Model
Welcome to our ASL hand sign recognition model, trained on the [Kaggle ASL Hand Sign Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)! Our goal for this model was to utilize ML and Computer Vision to aid in the interpretation of the ASL Hand Sign alphabet, as the vast majority of the American population are unable to understand it. For more information, please view our [Report](https://github.com/Sakidoe/ASL-Hand-Sign-Recognition/blob/main/American_Sign_Language__ASL__Letter_Recognition_and_Real_Time_Translatio.pdf).

Usage:
Initially, download and 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the following commands for 
```
python3 train_asl.py
python3 test_asl.py 
```
For our Webcam implementation (Beta):
```
python3 webcam_demo.py
```
